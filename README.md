# CS765 - Group D: Evolved Environments in Evolutionary Robotics

(for when we make it public, if we do ðŸ˜‚): Welcome! This is a project for COMPSCI 765 @ UoA. Its aim is to investigate the complexity of behaviour seen from embodied, situated agents when their environments are allowed to evolve as well.
